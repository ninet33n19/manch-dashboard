      heading: "Definition Of Neutral Evaluation",
      content: "Neutral Evaluation is a process in which a neutral third party, often an expert in the subject matter of the dispute, assesses the strengths and weaknesses of each side's arguments and evidence. The evaluator then provides a non-binding opinion on the likely outcome of the case, which can help the parties reach a settlement. This ADR method is particularly useful for complex cases requiring technical expertise or when parties need an objective assessment of their positions. The process allows parties to gain clarity and facilitates early resolution, potentially avoiding the need for more formal dispute resolution methods like arbitration or litigation."
