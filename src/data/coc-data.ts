      title: "1) Preamble",
      content: `The use of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) to resolve various disputes is growing extensively in India due to its speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Those acting as conciliators and arbitrators hold significant responsibilities to the public and the disputing parties, including upholding high ethical standards during online arbitration. Manch (the “Manch ODR Platform”) has established this Code of Conduct (“Code”) to guide the conciliators, Mediators and arbitrators on its platform (“Conciliators, Mediators & Arbitrators”). This Code outlines generally accepted standards of ethical conduct to maintain high ethical standards and foster continued confidence in the ODR process.`,

It complements, rather than replaces, the Manch Rules of Arbitration or generally accepted principles applicable to conciliation or arbitration. This Code is not grounds for setting aside any award but ensures transparency and may result in removal from empanelment if necessary.`,
